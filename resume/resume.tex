\textbf{PROGRAMMING}~\\
\vspace{-4mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \addtolength{\itemsep}{-2mm}
	\item \indent Well-versed and write regularly in: C, MPI, Perl, Bash, PHP, HTML, JavaScript
	\item \indent Occasionally write in: Ruby, Python, Java, C++
	\item \indent More broadly, I hold that a single technology to solve all problems does not exist. As such, I believe in cultivating the ability to quickly learn new languages and technologies rather than locking myself into one or two specialties.
